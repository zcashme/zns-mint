# `mint/otp.rs` design record

## 2026-09-21 — The birth is one constructor (#120)

- `OtpRequest::pending_challenge` births the pair the run loop used to
  hand-write twice — the `Challenge` memo and the pending it arms, one
  code in two bodies, expired at D_OTP. Both lanes call it; the
  hand-copies are gone. Encoding stays with the callers: an
  unencodable challenge is dead at the relay and unreachable in
  liveness — lane policy, not birth.
